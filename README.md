# Lab5GameEngines
Here is a link to my webgl build https://roywales.github.io/Lab5GameEngines/

I set up my project so that left click creates a cub and right click creates a Capsule. In order to do this I created new classes for capsulePlacer and placeCapsuleCommand and in the input plane I added the right click action.
